The OLIST STORE is an e-commerce business headquartered in Sao Paulo, Brazil. This firm acts as a single point of contact between various small businesses and the customers who wish to buy their products. In this project We are given multiple tables in CSV format and a schema depicting how these tables are connected. After connecting all the 8 tables, we analyze the entire dataset. It contains multiple categorical and numerical columns and information about 100k orders made at multiple marketplaces between 2016 to 2018.
In this project we are provided with 5 KPIâ€™s on which we have to work & provide answers & solutions by analyzing the dataset. During this project we worked in different phases & tools. Steps involved in this process were data cleaning using power query, data modeling for fact & dimensions table based on the basis of primary & foreign key relationship present in the reference image provided.
